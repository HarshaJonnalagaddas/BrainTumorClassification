# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification with EfficientNet and Grad-CAM

This repository contains a deep learning pipeline that performs multi-class classification of brain tumors using MRI scans. It achieves high accuracy using **EfficientNet-B1**, and provides **Grad-CAM visualizations** to interpret model decisions.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights
- 98.861% validation accuracy on the Kaggle brain tumor MRI dataset.
- Grad-CAM for interpretable deep learning.
- TensorFlow/Keras implementation with full reproducibility.
- Clean and modular notebook on Google Colab.
